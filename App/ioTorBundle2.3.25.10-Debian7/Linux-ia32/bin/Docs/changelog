Tor Browser Bundle (2.3.25-4); suite=linux

  * Update Firefox to 17.0.3esr
  * Downgrade OpenSSL to 1.0.0k
  * Update libpng to 1.5.14
  * Update NoScript to 2.6.5.7
  * Firefox patch changes:
    - Exempt remote @font-face fonts from font limits (and prefer them).
      (closes: #8270)
      * Remote fonts (aka "User Fonts") are not a fingerprinting threat, so
      they should not count towards our CSS font count limits. Moreover,
      if a CSS font-family rule lists any remote fonts, those fonts are
      preferred over the local fonts, so we do not reduce the font count
      for that rule.
      * This vastly improves rendering and typography for many websites.
    - Disable WebRTC in Firefox build options. (closes: 8178)
      * WebRTC isn't slated to be enabled until Firefox 18, but the code
        was getting compiled in already and is capable of creating UDP Sockets
        and bypassing Tor. We disable it from build as a safety measure.
    - Move prefs.js into omni.ja and extension-overrides. (closes: 3944)
      * This causes our browser pref changes to appear as defaults. It also
        means that future updates of TBB should preserve user pref settings.
    - Fix a use-after-free that caused crashing on MacOS (closes: 8234)
    - Eliminate several redundant, useless, and deprecated Firefox pref settings
    - Report Firefox 17.0 as the Tor Browser user agent
    - Use Firefox's click-to-play barrier for plugins instead of NoScript
    - Set the Tor SOCKS+Control ports to 9150, 9151 respectively on all platforms
      * This fixes a SOCKS race condition with our SOCKS autoport configuration
        and HTTPS-Everywhere's Tor test. Firefox 17 appears to cache proxy
        settings per URL now, which resulted in a proxy error for
        check.torproject.org if we lost the race.
  * Torbutton was updated to 1.5.0. The following issues were fixed:
    - Remove old toggle observers and related code (closes: #5279)
    - Simplify Security Preference UI and associated pref updates (closes: #3100)
    - Eliminate redundancy in our Flash/plugin disabling code (closes: #1305)
    - Leave most preferences under Tor Browser's control (closes: #3944)
    - Disable toggle-on-startup and crash detection logic (closes: #7974)
    - Disable/remove toggle-mode code and related observers (closes: #5279)
    - Add menu hint to Torbutton icon (closes: #6431)
    - Make Torbutton icon flash a warning symbol if TBB is out of date (closes: #7495)
    - Perform version check every time there's a new tab. (closes: #6096)
    - Rate limit version check queries to once every 1.5hrs max. (closes: #6156)
    - misc: Allow WebGL and DOM storage.
    - misc: Disable independent Torbutton updates
    - misc: Change the recommended SOCKSPort to 9150 (to match TBB)
